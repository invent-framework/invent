PyperCard Tutorials
===================

The following tutorials are for anyone who wants to use PyperCard to create
their own GUI driven applications that run on Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and
iOS.

We assume only two things:

1. You're comfortable typing commands into your computer via the command line.
2. You know a little of, or are starting to learn the Python programming
   language.

By the end of these relatively short and simple tutorials you'll know how to
build and share applications with PyperCard. If you want further help and
support, please don't hesitate to
`join our chat channel <https://gitter.im/pypercard/community>`_.

Most of all, we're a friendly project and want folks to flourish with our code,
so don't hesitate to get involved, give feedback and constructive critique.
Respectful collaboration wins here.
