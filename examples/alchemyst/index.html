      <p>Lake Zurich reflected the whispy white autumn clouds, yet the water
      was clear enough that it was easy to spot fish and see the sandy bed
      several metres below. The fresh smell of reeds and algae was in the air.
      Distant and indistinct sounds from the shore could be heard over the
      lapping of the water against the hull.</p>
      <p>The dinghy glided through the water towards an outcrop covered in
      trees within which could be seen an irregular group of white-washed
      towers and walls.</p>
      <p>The taciturn youth at the helm had simply promised to land at a
      secret location ripe for exploration...</p>
      <p>...and so you drifted towards your destination.</p>

      <p>"{name}, this is where you get off", said the youth.</p>
      <p>He avoided making eye contact whilst offering a hand onto the shore of
      the lake.</p>
      <p>As quickly as possible he pushed off and, without turning around,
      waved as he sailed towards the middle of the lake.</p>
