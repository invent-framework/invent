    A widget is a UI component drawn onto the interface in some way.

    * A unique human friendly name that's meaningful in the context of the
      application (if none is given, one is automatically generated).
    * A unique id (if none is given, one is automatically generated).
    * A render function that takes the widget's container and renders
      itself as an HTML element into the container.
    * An optional indication of the channel[s] to which it broadcasts
      messages (defaults to the id).
    * A publish method that takes the name of a message blueprint, and
      associated kwargs, and publishes it to the channel[s] set for the
      widget.
