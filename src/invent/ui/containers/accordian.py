    Accordian is a vertical container box in which only one child component is
    visible at a time. The Accordian container automatically handles the
    visibility of its children based on the selected child.

    The Accordian container is useful for displaying a large number of child
    components in a compact manner. The Accordian container is a subclass of
    the Column container and inherits all of its properties and methods.
