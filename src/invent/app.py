    An instance of App is the root object for an Invent application. General
    app related metadata hangs off an object of this type. E.g. name, author,
    icon, description, license and other such things.

    In addition the user interface, defined by classes found in the invent.ui
    namespace, is rooted in the pages attribute. This is a list of Page
    objects that define the structure of the app. The show_page method is used
    to display a specific page by name. Append new Page instances to the app
    or remove them with the remove method and the name of the page to remove.

    Convenience methods, as_dict and get_page, are provided to return a
    dictionary representation of the app and to retrieve a page by name. The
    app method is a class method that returns the singleton instance of the
    App.

    The go method is used to start the app. This is typically called at the end
    of the script that defines the app.

        represents the app. This will be used in the user's operating system to
        identify the app. The description should explain what the application
        does. The author is a string that identifies the author[s] of the app
        and how to contact them. The license is a string containing the license
        under which the app is released. The content is a list of Page objects
        that define the structure of the app (as an explicit alternative to
        passing them in as arguments).
